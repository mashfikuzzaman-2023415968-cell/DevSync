# DevSync progress

## Current state
- **Current owner:** Mashfikuzzaman Taeen (team leader)
- **Current phase:** 2 — Design system, app shell, landing page
- **Last gate result:** `PHASE 2 GATE: PASS` (2026-10-17; backend 445 tests, 87.7% coverage, security suite 82; frontend 218 tests; E2E 36; 82 visual baselines; Lighthouse desktop 97 / mobile 96; 60 fps on the GPU)
- **In progress:** nothing; Phase 2 complete, tagged `phase-2` and pushed to GitHub (`main`, `phase-2`)
- **Very next step:** Phase 3 (profiles, portfolio, files, skill tests) in Plan Mode; the student plans manual testing of Phases 0–2 first

## Known issues
- This laptop runs Apache on port 80: for `make up`, set `HTTP_PORT=8080` in `.env` or stop Apache.
- `make certs` produced a self-signed certificate; install mkcert before Demo 1 (D3).
- Node 20 is end-of-life; move the team to Node 22 LTS before Demo 1 (D15).
- Tester's human check of `docs/security-reviews/phase-00.md`, `phase-01.md` and `phase-02.md` is pending (Sara).
- The gate's frame-rate step needs a GPU (`/dev/dri`); run the gate on a laptop (D28). Long gate runs are best started with `systemd-run --user` so closing a terminal or chat doesn't kill them.
- The 2021 STI paper is cited without a link (no DOI found); add the IEEE Xplore URL when known.
- Existing dev databases: run `make migrate` (migration 0002); create an admin with `make create-admin`.

## Session log (newest first)
### 2026-10-17 — Taeen (with Claude Code), Phase 2
- **Done:** Phase 2 plan approved (`docs/plans/phase-02.md`); design tokens (light/dark), theme
  and reduced-motion providers, motion system + lint rule; component library on Radix; role
  shells (sidebar, tab bar, command palette, toasts, offline/error/coming-soon pages); homepage
  per §13.11 with the 3D talent constellation (slim three entry, poster first, fallbacks),
  stills and social preview; auth screens restyled with password rules up front;
  `/public/stats`, `/client-errors`, migration 0003; `devsync-ui` skill; UI kit (dev only).
- **Security review:** `docs/security-reviews/phase-02.md`, 0 unresolved high, 5 findings fixed
  (Zod eval under CSP, Radix styles via a per-response nonce, `.dockerignore` keeping `.env` out
  of build contexts, …).
- **Gate:** several passes. Performance work from Lighthouse (desktop 78 → 97, mobile 60 → 96),
  responsive-matrix fixes, the 60 fps check moved to the laptop GPU. Decisions D21–D28.
- **Next:** manual testing of Phases 0–2 by the student; then Phase 3 in Plan Mode.
- **Blockers:** none.
### 2026-10-17 — Taeen (with Claude Code), Phase 1
- **Done:** Phase 1 plan approved (`docs/plans/phase-01.md`); migration 0002 (identity tables,
  RLS ENABLE+FORCE on every table, SECURITY DEFINER pre-auth functions, settings v2 with rate
  limits); Argon2id + breached list + zxcvbn; rotating server-side sessions; CSRF; Redis rate
  limits; ALTCHA CAPTCHA + honeypot + fill time; lockout; admin TOTP, recovery codes, step-up;
  deny-by-default authz with route × role matrix; outbox email + lifecycle jobs; frontend auth
  screens (login, admin TOTP, register, verify, forgot/reset, settings, role homes) with guards.
- **Security review:** `docs/security-reviews/phase-01.md`, 0 unresolved high, 7 findings fixed.
- **Gate:** three passes. Fixes: narrower semgrep rule, timing test with interleaved medians,
  typographic apostrophes in UI copy, forms wait out the 2 s minimum fill time instead of
  failing (fast password-manager users), smoke test ignores the expected anonymous `/me` 401.
  DECISIONS D19–D20.
- **Next:** Phase 2 in Plan Mode.
- **Blockers:** none.
### 2026-10-17 — Taeen (with Claude Code)
- **Done:** repository cloned; spec, paper and proposal studied; Phase 0 plan approved
  (`docs/plans/phase-00.md`); backend core (config, logging, errors, middleware, health,
  metrics, money, clock), migration 0001 (settings, hash-chained append-only audit log,
  jobs, idempotency keys), platform settings schema/service, RQ worker + scheduler, gate and
  checker scripts, Nginx/Compose/Postgres roles, frontend scaffold with tokens, docs, CI.
- **Gate:** four passes; fixes recorded in DECISIONS D15–D18 (frontend toolchain CVEs, Nginx
  host allowlist, SHA-pinned actions, Trivy DB source, Nginx 1.30/trixie base). Docker moved
  from the snap to Docker's apt packages (D17). Design skills installed after review (D14).
- **Next:** Phase 1 in Plan Mode.
- **Blockers:** none.
