## Known issues
- This laptop runs Apache on port 80: for `make up`, set `HTTP_PORT=8080` in `.env` or stop Apache.
- `make certs` produced a self-signed certificate; install mkcert before Demo 1 (D3).
- Node 20 is end-of-life; move the team to Node 22 LTS before Demo 1 (D15).
- Tester's human check of `docs/security-reviews/phase-00.md` is pending (Sara).

## Session log (newest first)
### 2026-10-17 — Taeen (with Claude Code)
- **Done:** repository cloned; spec, paper and proposal studied; Phase 0 plan approved
  (`docs/plans/phase-00.md`); backend core (config, logging, errors, middleware, health,
  metrics, money, clock), migration 0001 (settings, hash-chained append-only audit log,
  jobs, idempotency keys), platform settings schema/service, RQ worker + scheduler, gate and
  checker scripts, Nginx/Compose/Postgres roles, frontend scaffold with tokens, docs, CI.
- **Gate:** four passes; fixes recorded in DECISIONS D15–D18 (frontend toolchain CVEs, Nginx
